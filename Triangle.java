    Assignment: Selection Structures - Part 2: Perimeter of a Triangle

    This program is to calculate the perimeter of a triangle.  The user is
    prompt to input the lenght of each side.  An input validation is 
    implemented to ensure that the lenghts entered equate to a valid 
    triangle.  For this validation, sum of two sides should result in being
    greater than the side that's left over.
